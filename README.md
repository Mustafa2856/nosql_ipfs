## Inspiration
Most Databases Storage services are Centralized, So Single Point of Failure {Slow Speed, Bottleneck Point Leading to Less Efficiency & No-Fault Tolerance} is Possible. Also, from Security Point of View, Data Breaches would lead to Huge Financial Losses.
Therefore, we decided to Build NoSQL-IPFS.

## What it Basically Does?
NoSQL-IPFS is NoSQL Database service that provides users with all functions of a normal database, but in a decentralized manner (using IPFS Storage).
It has the same capabilities as a standard NoSQL database, including the ability to create, add and update databases, but it is still decentralised to avoid security risks. 
This website has exceptional efficiency and outperforms conventional solutions because to IPFS's robust file sharing mechanism and sophisticated processing techniques.

Use a decentralized database with your data being encrypted and stored over a decentralized web on IPFS.
